            <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p>
                I have extensive experience working both alone and as part of a team on
                often time-sensitive, challenging web development projects that require
                outstanding creative and technical capabilities and the ability to ensure all
                work is optimized across a wide range of platforms. I take my work as a Web Developer
                seriously, and this means I always ensure my skills are kept up to date within this rapidly
                changing industry. If you hire me as your Web Developer, I assure you I will fit into your team quickly,
                I will always put the commercial needs of your business at the forefront of everything I do, and the work
                I carry out will be consistent to a first-class standard.
